# MD5-HASH-FFMPEG-CHECK
Helps to check if received I Frames are identical or not by running the hash function on the data received.

Ethernet results show that the I frame data remains same.

However, over Wi-Fi the Hash generated changes indicating that I Frame data has been altered. 

This can also be used to keep track of I frames as a whole.

FFMPEG-SO repo has been used to generate the necessary FFMPEG- WRAPPERS
